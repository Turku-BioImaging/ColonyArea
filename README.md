## Abstract:

Clonogenic assays measure the survival and growth of a single mammalian cell into a colony. These colony or focus formation assays are widely used in radiation biology and cancer biology, where they are employed to study resistance of cancer cells to radiation or the transforming potential of genes, respectively.

We have developed “ColonyArea”, an ImageJ-plugin that is optimized to perform standard analysis of colony formation assays conducted in 6- to 24-well dishes. The plugin processes each well individually and determines not the colony number, but the area of the well covered with cells, also taking the intensity into account.

## Maintenance

Beginning in October 2022, maintenance of this plugin is handled by [Turku BioImaging](https://bioimaging.fi), a broad-based, interdisciplinary science and infrastructure umbrella that aims to unite bioimaging expertise in Turku and elsewhere in Finland. Turku BioImaging is jointly operated by the [University of Turku](https://utu.fi) and [Åbo Akademi University](https://abo.fi).
